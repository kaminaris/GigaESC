# Things to check before starting up VESC for first time

1. Visual inspection for solder bridges and correct orientation of polarized parts.
2. Check for shorts between power rails:
   - battery + and -
   - motor phases
   - 12V, 5V, and 3.3V rails
3. Check if all drivers capacitors have roughly the same voltage drop.
4. Use a current-limited power supply for initial power-up 1-3A should be enough.
